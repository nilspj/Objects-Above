Objects Above - TLE Data Analysis
Is a small project for analysing the density of Debris objects in the Space-Track TLE-catalogue above a given location on Earth at a given time. The aim is to see if it is possible to determine a safe launch window for a rocket to be launched into orbit with respect to space debris.
